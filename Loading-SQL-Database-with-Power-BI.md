Here is how to use Power BI on Windows to load a SQL Server database running on a Linux virtual machine.

Before you do this, make sure you have started your virtual machine on Linux with Microsoft SQL Server running.

When you start the program, you will have multiple options for adding data to your report.

Choose "Import data from SQL Server."

Enter the server name: Here, I use the Linux command ```hostname```

My hostname is ```localhost.localdomain```  .
I copy that into the Server field in Power BI.

In the "database(optional)" field, you can put in the database name if you would like. I know the name of the database being used is "HR", so I will insert it there.
